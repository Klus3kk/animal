# 🐾 Animal Language - Introduction

Welcome to the **Animal Language**, a custom programming language written in Go that speaks in animalistic expressions! 🐕

Animal is not just a language — it's a creative playground for learning how programming languages work under the hood. From lexical analysis to interpretation, it brings a unique syntax inspired by animal behavior and sounds.

## 🌟 What is Animal?

**Animal** is a whimsical yet powerful interpreted language where programs look like dialogues between beasts. It was designed to:

- Explore compiler and interpreter construction
- Create a unique programming experience
- Make learning about languages fun and memorable

## 💡 Why Animal?

Because it's:
- 🧠 **Educational** – learn how parsing and interpreting work.
- 🎨 **Creative** – enjoy a syntax inspired by animal communication.
- 🧪 **Experimental** – easy to extend with new keywords, features, and fun DSL tricks.

## ✅ Current Capabilities

- 🧮 Arithmetic with custom operators (`meow`, `woof`, `soar`, etc.)
- 🐾 Conditionals (`growl`, `sniff`, `wag`)
- 🔁 Loops (`leap`, `pounce`)
- 🗣 Print & input (`roar`, `listen`)
- 🐚 Functions (`howl`) with support for arguments and return
- 🐕 Nest structures (like classes)
- 📃 Lists with powerful methods
- 🧰 Variable assignment with `->`

## 🚧 Status

This is an evolving language, currently in version **v0.5.0**, with many features implemented and more to come:
- Testing framework (planned)
- File imports / modules (planned)
- Better error reporting (planned)
- REPL enhancements (planned)

## 👀 Example
```anml
howl greet(name) {
    roar "Hello", name
}

greet("Fox")
```
