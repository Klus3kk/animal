# Animal Language - Introduction

Welcome to the **Animal Language**, a custom programming language written in Go that speaks in animalistic expressions! 

## What is Animal?

**Animal** is a whimsical yet powerful interpreted language where programs look like dialogues between beasts. It was designed to:

- Explore compiler and interpreter construction
- Create a unique programming experience
- Make learning about languages fun and memorable

## Current Capabilities

- Arithmetic with custom operators (`meow`, `woof`, `soar`, etc.)
- Conditionals (`growl`, `sniff`, `wag`)
- Loops (`leap`, `pounce`)
- Print & input (`roar`, `listen`)
- Functions (`howl`) with support for arguments and return
- Nest structures (like classes)
- Lists with powerful methods
- Variable assignment with `->`

## Status

This is an evolving language, currently in version **v0.5.0**, with many features implemented and more to come:
- Testing framework (planned)
- File imports / modules (planned)
- Better error reporting (planned)
- REPL enhancements (planned)

## Example
```anml
howl greet(name) {
    roar "Hello", name
}

greet("Fox")
```
