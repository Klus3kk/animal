.. code-block:: animal

   howl greet(name) {
       roar "Hello", name
   }

   greet("World")  :: Prints "Hello World"

Features
--------

* **Intuitive Syntax**: Animal sounds replace traditional operators - ``meow`` for addition, ``woof`` for subtraction
* **Expressive Control Flow**: ``growl``/``sniff``/``wag`` for conditionals, ``leap`` for for-loops, ``pounce`` for while-loops
* **Powerful Data Structures**: Lists with built-in methods and nestable structures
* **Custom Object System**: Define reusable components with the ``nest`` keyword
* **Integrated File I/O**: Read and write files easily with animal-themed functions
