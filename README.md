# Animal

The goal of this project is to create a new programming language with unique features and applications. The basic functions, operators etc. will be correlated to animals characteristics and sounds.
You can test the language by writing:

```bash
./animal
```

## Features

* Defining the syntax and semantics of the language.
* Implementing a compiler or interpreter.
* Creating standard libraries.
* Writing sample programs.

## Technologies

* Go language,
* Lexer,
* Parser,
* Tokens.
